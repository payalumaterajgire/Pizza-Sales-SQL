🍕 Exploring Pizza Sales Through SQL 📊

Hey!! 👋 

As part of my recent studies in SQL data analysis, I embarked on a fascinating project diving into pizza sales metrics. 🍕 Here's a glimpse into what I've been up to:

Basic Analysis:
📈 Total Orders: I started by crunching numbers to retrieve the total number of pizza orders placed, giving me a solid foundation of sales volume.
💰 Revenue Calculation: Calculating total revenue from pizza sales helped me understand the financial performance of different products.
🌟 Highest-Priced Pizza: Identifying the highest-priced pizza gave insights into premium offerings and their impact.
📏 Most Common Pizza Size: Analyzing the most common pizza size ordered provided insights into customer preferences.
📊 Top 5 Pizza Types: Listing the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities highlighted customer favorites.

Intermediate Analysis:
🍕 Quantity by Pizza Category: I joined tables to analyze the total quantity ordered for each pizza category, revealing which types were most popular.
🕒 Hourly Order Distribution: Studying order distribution by hour helped identify peak times and optimize operations.
📦 Category-Wise Distribution: By joining relevant tables, I examined how pizzas were distributed across different categories.
📅 Daily Average Orders: Grouping orders by date, I calculated the average number of pizzas ordered per day to track daily trends.
💡 Top 3 Pizza Types by Revenue: Identifying the top 3 pizza types by revenue shed light on the most profitable products.

Advanced Analysis:
📈 Revenue Contribution: Calculating the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue provided insights into product profitability.
📉 Cumulative Revenue Trends: Analyzing cumulative revenue over time helped me spot trends and seasonal variations.
🥇 Top 3 Pizza Types per Category: Determining the top 3 pizza types based on revenue for each category gave a detailed view of performance across different segments.

This project not only sharpened my SQL skills but also deepened my understanding of data-driven decision-making in business. I'm excited to apply these insights to future projects and contribute to data-driven strategies in the industry. 🚀
